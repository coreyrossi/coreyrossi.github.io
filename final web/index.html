        Hey there, My name is Corey Rossi. I am 23 years old and I live in San Francisco with my boyfriend Ben and our black cat Peanut. Throughout this site you will see small selections of work I have completed for the VMD-105 class that I have taken at City College of San Francisco.

        I have experience in most Adobe programs, but the ones i've spent the most time on are Photoshop and Illustrator. pretty much all the elements of my website were made in Illustrator since the images it produces are usually of much higher quality. This website as a whole was a lot of fun to make. I was able to use the skills I learned having a Myspace and Tumblr page to fully customize this site to my liking. This is my first website even though a few years ago I did take a JavaScript course (not as easy as html).
